# voice_assistant_using_python

An interface known as a voice assistant processes the user's voice instructions and performs the necessary actions. The task could involve responding to user queries, establishing a connection with the device, and carrying out any other tasks the user has chosen, such as accessing Google, etc. Here, Python will be used to simulate such a system.

### Based on the commands we add to our assistant, other modules may be utilised. In this tutorial, we'll use the following:

1. Subprocess: This module can be used to get data from the device in order to carry out operations like shutdown and sleep.

2. Wolframalpha: Using Wolfram's algorithms, knowledge base, and AI technology, this module assists us in providing some answers to problems.

3. Pyttsx3: Using this module facilitates text-to-speech conversion.

4. Datetime: To obtain the current time, use this module.

5. Wikipedia: This module assists in launching Wikipedia and conducting a search for the requested information.

6. Webbrowser: With this module, you can also launch the browser and do searches.

7. Winshell and OS: This module facilitates access to the device's files and folders.

8. Pyjokes: The user can listen to a variety of jokes in the Pyjokes module.

9. Requests: This facilitates url-based website access.

10. Shutil: With this, we can work with and alter the files on the device.

11. Smtplib: This module facilitates email sending.

12. Bs4: This module aids in information extraction from internet request.

13. Tkinter:Â  We use this module to build the GUI
